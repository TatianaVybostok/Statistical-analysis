# Statistical-analysis
Statistical analysis of anomaly rates in power distribution grid and geomagnetic activity represented with K index

The main code for statistical analysis consist of four python files :
- run2.py
- intervaly2.py
- datumy2.py
- MAIN2.py

The run2.py code executes three remaining codes. Code is quite old, it needs refactoring.

- fourier_der.py computes fourier derivative
- correlation_k_dist.py and kindex_hurbanovo.py create plots
